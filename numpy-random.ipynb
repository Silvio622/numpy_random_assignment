    "### What is the purpose of the numpy.random package\n",
    "The \"numpy.random\" package creates random numbers. Random means it creates numbers what can not be predicted. But it doesn't mean the numbers are unique. The same number can be created several times. The \"numpy.random\" package creates Pseudo random numbers. The numbers will be generated by a computer algorithm so they are not really random. The algorithm uses a combination of a BitGenerator and a Generator[1]. The Bitgenerator creates sequences of random numbers as unsigned integer words with a length of 32 or 64 bits. The Generator uses those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions like normal, uniform and binomial distribution to generate the random numbers. The Bitgenerator uses as default the \"PCG64\" Generator. To initialize the Bitgenerator it uses a seed.\n",
    "#### What is a seed?\n",
    "Usually the seed is the time on the computer in microsecond then the \"numpy.random\" function is activated. The seed can be also activated by a keystroke, mouse movement or data on the network. The role of the seed is to start the Bitgenerator to start the \"numpy.random\" process. The new PCG64 seed generator outperformance the older Mersenne Twister generator. The PCG64 generator is twice as fast as the Mersenne Twister generator, is more secure and uses less memory only 16 byte instead of 2.5 kilobyte for a seed[2]. The generators will be used in simple random data, permutations and distribution functions to generate random numbers. \n",
    "#### Creating the same  numbers all the time\n",
    "To testing code and algorithms it is useful to generate the same numbers all the time. The package \"numpy.random\" has a class called \"Generator\" where the same numbers can be produced[3],[4].\n",
    "Import the Generator class as well as the PCG64 or MT19937(Mersenne Twister)class. It is better to use the PCG64 class as descripted above. The numbers can be changed by changing the integer number in the brackets(1234). In the next line the BitGenerator generates the same numbers in the PCG64 class when the seed is activated. The numbers will be passed on to the Generator. The Generator uses the uniform distribution to generate the 10 numbers from 0 to 9 as float numbers.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64\n",
    "rg = Generator(PCG64(1234))# use the PCG64 class MT19937 (Mersenne Twister)class could be used as well\n",
    "x = rg.uniform(0,10,10)# uses the uniform distribution other distribution can be used as well\n",
